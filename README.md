# README #

This is my high school leaving project written in Django, I know the code sucks but it was the first time I coded in Python

### How do I get set up? ###

You can't because you need the exact information about the server configuration (it wasn't my job so it is not in this repository)


### Contribution guidelines ###

The whole project was written only by me **Zoltán Onódy**

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner and developer ---> **Zotán Onódy** - zoltan.onody@gmail.com
* Server site jobs ---> **Kryštof Kiss** - kissko1995@gmail.com 

### Résumé ###
I have chosen this project mainly because I have seen a big challenge in it. Long story short, this project is a game-hosting website, people who visit this website can configure and  start their own virtual game servers and play on them with friends. I created both the design and the core of this website with framework Django and Twitter Bootstrap. During the work I fall in a lot of problems with optimalization but my algorithmic skills helped me to solve them. 
This website was created as my high school leaving project and I will release it as open source by the end of May 2015.
Final version of this website will surely be different from documentation, the reasons are more optimalization, modernization and improvements.
